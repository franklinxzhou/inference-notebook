Franklin's Statistical Inference Notebook
=======================================

This notebook is an expansion of Prof. Surya Tokdar's Statistical Inference course at Duke University. It aims to expand the lecture notes with additional explanations, examples, and derivations. It aligns the content with the textbook "Statistical Inference" by Casella and Berger (2002).
